I was born in Petr√≥polis, a small (and cold) city in the mountains of Rio de Janeiro. There, in 2010, I've concluded an undergraduated degree in information systems.

I've started programming professionally in 2006, mainly working with Progress 4GL (blahhhrr), C# with webforms (not kidding!) and window forms with SQL Server.
<br clear="all"><br>
Nowadays, i work most of the time using Ruby'n Rails and Javascript, but any time i have a chance, i try to program using different languages such Java, C#, F#, Python ...

Besides programming, guitar, cold beer, Botafogo and travels are my passions.
